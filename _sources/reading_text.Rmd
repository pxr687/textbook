# Reading data from text files

We have been reading various values from text files using the file `open`
function, and then processing the lines in the file.

Here is some revision on how to do that, going from the crude to the elegant
way.

First we write a little text file out to disk:

```{python}
numbers = [1.2, 2.3, 3.4, 4.5]
fobj = open('some_numbers.txt', 'wt')
for number in numbers:
    # String version of number, plus end-of-line character
    fobj.write(str(number) + '\n')
fobj.close()
```

Now we read it back again. First, we will read the all the lines in one shot,
returning a list of strings:

```{python}
fobj = open('some_numbers.txt', 'rt')
lines = fobj.readlines()
len(lines)
```

```{python}
lines[0]
```

Next we will read the file, but converting each number to a float:

```{python}
fobj = open('some_numbers.txt', 'rt')
numbers_again = []
for line in fobj.readlines():
    numbers_again.append(float(line))
numbers_again
```

In fact we read these data even more concisely, and quickly, by using
`np.loadtxt`.

```{python}
import numpy as np
```

```{python}
np.loadtxt('some_numbers.txt')
```
